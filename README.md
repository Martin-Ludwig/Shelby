## About

I want to build a text-based role-playing game. I want to experiment and learn how to use GPT to craft stories. Difficulties are to stay in context of the current story arc in a big crafted story, with maybe interfering information about past events. It may also be challenging to save the conversation and extract only important information for a prompt. I also want to implement a character design that needs to be tailored for GPT. 

Can GPT predict and even influence the future of a story to create a more compelling story for the user?
